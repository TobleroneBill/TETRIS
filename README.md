# TETRIS
PyGame Tetris

This is my tetris Game engine that I have been working really hard on and have been tryin to make ever since i started programming, so this is a massive milestone for me

### Controls

- A/D - Move piece left or right
- Left/Right Key - Rotate in that direction. When playing this might feel a little wierd, but I think this is because in normal tetris, you can only rotate in a single direction (that or my rotation matrix thing isnt working properly (but i think it is))

No scoring yet as this is V1.0, but these are the features I'm planning to add and are also visible in the source code:

### Coming Updates:
- V 1.1 - up next queue, score and level increase
- V 1.2 - Main Menu, Sounds and perhaps some graphics ;)
- V 1.3 - Multiple Game Modes - single block mode, maybe a puzzle mode, marathon etc. (will think about this when i get to it)

There should also be a pyinstaller .exe if you are reading this, but if not then its because something went horrible wrong, as it did last time i used pyinstaller on a tkinter project :/
