# TETRIS
PyGame Tetris

Itchio Link: https://billiams.itch.io/pytris

This is my tetris Game engine that I have been working really hard on and have been trying to make ever since i started programming, so this is a massive milestone for me

### Controls

- A/D - Move piece left or right
- Left/Right Key - Rotate in that direction.
- Space - Fast Place (sends piece to the bottom)

No scoring yet as this is V1.0, but these are the features I'm planning to add and are also visible in the source code:

# Currently at 1.1 but putting development on hold to do other stuff

### Coming Updates:
- V 1.2 - Main Menu, Sounds and perhaps some graphics ;)
- V 1.3 - Multiple Game Modes - single block mode, maybe a puzzle mode, marathon etc. (will think about this when i get to it)

There should also be a pyinstaller .exe if you are reading this, but if not then it's because something went horribly wrong, as it did last time i used pyinstaller on a tkinter project :/
